# loam

A small laboratory for asking what structures appear before we decide what a household system is supposed to be.

The project begins with a deliberately narrow question:

> If finite resources are distributed through time and purpose without assuming accounts, transactions, budgets, or envelopes, what structures appear on their own?

## Method

Use the smallest set of tools that can answer the current question.

The default core is:

- **Alloy** explores possible structures and counterexamples.
- **J** observes structures as arrays and exposes projection, loss, and shape.
- **Lean 4** proves observed laws generally when they become worth keeping and hosts the practical core.

Additional tools are introduced only when they add a distinct kind of answer:

- **TLA+ / TLC** for temporal behavior, operation order, and state-transition questions.
- **Apalache** for symbolic checking of selected TLA+ transition systems and inductive invariants.
- **SPIN / Promela** for explicit interleaving and protocol-order questions where concurrent process scheduling is the pressure point.
- **miniKanren** for genuinely relational or backwards search that the core cannot provide clearly enough.

Before adding an optional tool to a new observation, state what the current toolset cannot answer and what distinct result the extra tool is expected to produce.

Past observations that used an optional tool remain part of the evidence. They show cases where that tool had a distinct role; they do not create a permanent dependency.

Using every tool is not a goal. If two tools answer the same question in the same way, prefer the smaller combination.

## Current map

Observations 001–060 form the first completed arc from pre-household structure discovery to a practical split-stream persistence protocol. Observation 061 extends that protocol result to a multi-parent Resolution over an already-visible stable conflict frontier without claiming the same result for a moving frontier. See [`OBSERVATION_MAP.md`](OBSERVATION_MAP.md) for the current inventory of earned structure, derived views, overlays, protocol findings, and deliberately unearned concepts.

## Observation 001 — A World Before Envelopes

Start without these concepts:

- Account
- Transaction
- Budget
- Envelope
- Month
- Report

Begin only with finite resource units, time, purposes, and changing placement.

The first question is whether something we would later call an envelope is primitive data, or merely a projection that emerges from stable placement through time.

See `observations/001-a-world-before-envelopes.md` as the experiment develops.
